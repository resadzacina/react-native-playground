React Native playground is a small experimental React app meant to show multiple React features.

## features

- Login
- Tabs
- Swiper
- Components and backend integration code
- Activity List ( Github )

## Required for development

- React Native 0.16.0
- Node.js 5.1.0

## How to run

- `npm install` for adding all required node modules
- fix issue with dimensions package https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper/issues/31
- open XCode project and run from there

## Gotchas and tricks

The app can be happily debugged in Chrome by using the menu from the app `Debug in Chrome` and Voila :trophy:

There is an auto-reload feature which is very nice.

When adding assets the terminal and emulator need to be turned off and re-run.

Keep in mind that if you have two Chrome debuggers turned on at the same time, stuff will go crazy! :skull:

Sometimes the emulator can get stuck and in these cases you need to turn off all components (xcode, emulator, terminal, chrome   debuger) :skull:
