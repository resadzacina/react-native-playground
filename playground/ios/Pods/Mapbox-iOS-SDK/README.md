### iOS 3.0.0

- If you install this SDK via CocoaPods, CocoaPods version 0.38.0 or above is required. ([#2132](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2132))
- The `styleID` property has been removed from MGLMapView. Instead, set the `styleURL` property to an NSURL in the form `mapbox://styles/STYLE_ID`. If you previously set the style ID in Interface Builder’s Attributes inspector, delete the `styleID` entry from the User Defined Runtime Attributes section of the Identity inspector, then set the new “Style URL” inspectable to a value in the form `mapbox://styles/STYLE_ID`. ([#2632](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2632))
- Default styles such as Streets are no longer bundled with the SDK; instead, they are loaded at runtime from the style API on mapbox.com. As always, you can use these default styles with any valid access token, and Streets continues to be `MGLMapView`’s initial style. The `bundledStyleURLs` property on `MGLMapView` has been deprecated in favor of several class methods on `MGLStyle` that provide direct access to the default styles. ([#2746](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2746))
- The SDK now builds with Bitcode enabled. A version of libMapbox.a with Bitcode disabled is also available. ([#2332](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/2332), [#3003](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3003))
- The style URL can be set to a local resource: `asset://local-color.json` and `local-color.json` both resolve to a file named `local-color.json` in the application’s root folder. ([#3087](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3087))
- The double-tap-drag gesture for zooming in and out is now consistent with the Google Maps SDK. ([#2153](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2153))
- A new `MGLAnnotationImage.enabled` property allows you to disable touch events on individual annotations. ([#2501](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2501))
- Fixed a rendering issue that caused one-way arrows along tile boundaries to point due east instead of in the direction of travel. ([#2530](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2530))
- Fixed an issue that prevented zoom level–dependent style properties from updating after zooming programmatically with animation. ([#2951](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2951))
- Performance and appearance improvements during annotation adds & removes. ([#1688](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/1688))
- Overall improved performance during renders by not rendering faster than necessary. ([#1975](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/1975))
- Fixed a rendering issue with styles that use the `background-pattern` property. ([#2531](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2531))
- Fixed a crash when reusing a single `MGLMapView` across multiple `UIViewController`s. ([#2969](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2969))
- Fixed a crash on iPod touch and other devices or simulators without a cell carrier. ([#2687](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/2687))
- Eliminated flickering when opening and closing an overlay, such as an alert or action sheet. ([#2309](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2309))
- Labels can now line wrap on hyphens and other punctuation. ([#2598](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2598))
- A new delegate callback was added for observing taps to annotation callout views. ([#2596](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2596))
- `-mapViewRegionIsChanging:` is now sent to the map view’s delegate during gestures. ([#2700](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2700))
- Improved gesture recognition while the map is tilted. ([#2770](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2770))
- `-mapViewWillStartLoadingMap:` and `-mapViewDidFinishLoadingMap:` delegate methods now work. ([#2706](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2706))
- Removed CoreTelephony.framework dependency. ([#2581](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2581))
- Improved user location annotation responsiveness. ([#2643](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2643))
